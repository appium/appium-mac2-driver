[![Release](https://github.com/appium/appium-mac2-driver/actions/workflows/publish.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/appium/appium-mac2-driver/actions/workflows/publish.js.yml)


This is Appium driver for automating macOS applications using Apple's [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) framework.
The driver operates in scope of [W3C WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) with several custom extensions to cover operating-system specific scenarios.
The original idea and parts of the source code are borrowed from the Facebook's [WebDriverAgent](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent) project.

> [!NOTE]
> Since version 1.0.0 Mac2 driver has dropped the support of Appium 1, and is only compatible to Appium 2. Use the `appium driver install mac2`
> command to add it to your Appium 2 dist.


## Requirements

On top of standard Appium requirements Mac2 driver also expects the following prerequisites:

- macOS 11 or later
- Xcode 13 or later should be installed
    - `xcode-select` should be pointing to `<full_path_to_xcode_app>/Contents/Developer` developer directory instead of `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools` to run `xcodebuild` commands
- Xcode Helper app should be enabled for Accessibility access. The app itself could be usually found at `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Agents/Xcode Helper.app`. In order to enable Accessibility access for it simply open the parent folder in Finder: `open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Agents/` and drag & drop the `Xcode Helper` app to `Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility` list of your `System Preferences`. This action must only be done once.
- `testmanagerd` process requires UIAutomation authentication since macOS 12. `automationmodetool enable-automationmode-without-authentication` command may help to disable it. This may be particularly useful in CI environments. [Apple forum thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/693850).

### Doctor

Since driver version 1.9.0 you can automate the validation for the most of the above
requirements as well as various optional ones needed by driver extensions by running the
`appium driver doctor mac2` server command.


## Capabilities

Capability Name | Description
--- | ---
platformName | Should be set to `mac`
automationName | Must always be set to `mac2`. Values of automationName are compared case-insensitively.
appium:systemPort | The number of the port for the internal server to listen on. If not provided then Mac2Driver will use the default port `10100`.
appium:systemHost | The name of the host for the internal server to listen on. If not provided then Mac2Driver will use the default host address `127.0.0.1`. You could set it to `0.0.0.0` to make the server listening on all available network interfaces. It is also possible to set the particular interface name, for example `en1`.
appium:webDriverAgentMacUrl | Appium will connect to an existing WebDriverAgentMac instance at this URL instead of starting a new one. e.g. `http://192.168.10.1:10101`
appium:showServerLogs | Set it to `true` in order to include xcodebuild output to the Appium server log. `false` by default.
appium:bootstrapRoot | The full path to `WebDriverAgentMac` root folder where Xcode project of the server sources lives. By default this project is located in the same folder where the corresponding driver Node.js module lives.
appium:serverStartupTimeout | The number of milliseconds to wait util the WebDriverAgentMac project is built and started. `120000` by default
appium:bundleId | The bundle identifier of the application to automate, for example `com.apple.TextEdit`. This is an optional capability. If it is not provided then the session will be started without an application under test (actually, it will be Finder). If the application with the given identifier is not installed then an error will be thrown on session startup. If the application is already running then it will be moved to the foreground.
appium:arguments | Array of application command line arguments. This capability is only going to be applied if the application is not running on session startup.
appium:environment | A dictionary of environment variables (name->value) that are going to be passed to the application under test on top of environment variables inherited from the parent process. This capability is only going to be applied if the application is not running on session startup.
appium:skipAppKill | Whether to skip the termination of the application under test when the testing session quits. `false` by default. This capability is only going to be applied if `bundleId` is set.
appium:prerun | An object containing either `script` or `command` key. The value of each key must be a valid AppleScript script or command to be executed prior to the Mac2Driver session startup. See [AppleScript commands execution](#applescript-commands-execution) for more details. Example: `{command: 'do shell script "echo hello"'}`
appium:postrun | An object containing either `script` or `command` key. The value of each key must be a valid AppleScript script or command to be executed after Mac2Driver session is stopped. See [AppleScript commands execution](#applescript-commands-execution) for more details.
appium:noReset | Whether to restart the app whose bundle identifier was passed to capabilities as `bundleId` value if it was already running on the session startup (`false`, the default value) or just pick it up without changing the app state (`true`). Note that neither of `arguments` or `environment` capabilities will take effect if the app did not restart.
appium:appPath | The path to the application to automate, for example `/Applications/MyAppName.app`. This is an optional capability, but it requires `bundleId` to be present until mac2 driver v1.13.0. In earlier versions if `bundleId` is empty, `appPath` would be ignored. If the path is invalid or application is damaged/incomplete then an error will be thrown on session startup. This capability could be useful when you have multiple builds of the same application with the same bundleId on your machine (for example one production build in /Applications/ and several dev builds). If you provide bundleId only, the operating system could open any of these builds. By providing `appPath` you have a guarantee that the specified .app will be launched, rather than a random one.
appium:appLocale | A dictionary with the following possible entries: `locale` (application locale name, for example `uk_UA`), `language` (application language name, for example `de`), `useMetricUnits` (whether to use metric units for the app, if `false` then imperial units are used), `measurementUnits` (the name of measurement units to use in the app, for example `Inches`). This capability only changes the locale for the app under test, it does not modify the system locale. You can achieve the same effect by providing custom values to reserved app command line arguments like `-AppleLanguages` or `-AppleLocale` using the `appium:arguments` capability. Example: use `appLocale = {locale: "de", language: "de_DE"}` to start the app in German language (if no German resources are defined in the destination app bundle then the app is started with the default locale, usually en_US).
appium:appTimeZone | Defines the custom time zone override for the application under test. You can use UTC, PST, EST, as well as place-based timezone names such as America/Los_Angeles. The application must be (re)launched for the capability to take effect. See the [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for more details. The same behavior could be achieved by providing a custom value to the [TZ](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/86951#263395) environment variable via the `appium:environment` capability
appium:initialDeeplinkUrl | A deeplink URL used to run either the application assigned to `appium:bundleId`, or the default application assigned to handle the particular deeplink protocol if `appium:bundleId` is not set. An error is thrown on session init if either the value of the capability is not a valid URL, or XCTest was not able to associate it with any existing app, or the actual Xcode version is below *14.3*

## Element Attributes

Mac2 driver supports the following element attributes:

Name | Description | Example
--- | --- | ---
elementType | Integer-encoded element class. See the official documentation on [XCUIElementType enumeration](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementtype?language=objc) for more details. | '2'
frame | Coordinates of bounding element rectangle | {x: 1, y: 2.5, width: 100, height: 200}
placeholderValue | It is usually only present for text fields. For other element types it's mostly empty | 'my placeholder'
enabled | Contains `true` if the element is enabled | 'false'
focused | Contains `true` if the element has the keyboard input focus | 'false'
selected | Contains `true` if the element is selected | 'false'
hittable | Contains `true` if the element is hittable | 'true'
label | Element's label value. Could be empty | 'my label'
title | Element's title value. Could be empty | 'my title'
identifier | Element's accessibility identifier. Could be empty | 'identifier'
value | The value could be different depending on the actual element type. For example, text fields might have their text context there and sliders would contain the float position value, while switches would have either `1` or `0` | '1.5'

These attribute values could be retrieved from the page source output and then used for elements location. See the official documentation on [XCUIElementAttributes protocol](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielementattributes?language=objc) for more details on each attribute.

## Element Location

Mac2 driver supports the following location strategies:

Name | Description | Speed Ranking | Pseudocode
--- | --- |  --- | ---
accessibilityId, id, name | These all strategies are mapped to the same Mac2 driver ByIdentifier lookup strategy. The locator matches the passed value with element's `identifer` attribute case-sensitively. | `⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` | AppiumBy.accessibilityId("identifier"), By.id("identifier"), By.name("identifier")
className | Class name uses stringified element types for lookup | `⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` | By.className("XCUIElementTypePopUpButton")
predicate | Lookup by predicate is natively supported by XCTest and is as fast as previous lookup strategies. This lookup strategy could only use the supported [element attributes](#element-attributes). Unknown attribute names would throw an exception. Check [NSPredicate cheat sheet](https://academy.realm.io/posts/nspredicate-cheatsheet/) for more details on how to build effective and flexible locators. | `⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐` | AppiumBy.iOSNsPredicateString("elementType == 2 AND label BEGINSWITH 'Safari'")
classChain | This strategy is a combination of Xpath flexibility and fast predicate lookup. Prefer it over Xpath unless there is no other way to build the desired locator. Visit [Class Chain Construction Rules tutorial](https://github.com/facebookarchive/WebDriverAgent/wiki/Class-Chain-Queries-Construction-Rules) to get more knowledge on how to build class chain locators. | `⭐⭐⭐⭐` | AppiumBy.iOSClassChain("**/XCUIElementTypeRuler[$elementType == 72 AND value BEGINSWITH '10'$]")
xpath | For elements lookup XPath strategy the driver uses the same XML tree that is generated by page source API. [XPath 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/) is supported since driver version 1.20.0. All driver versions below 1.20.0 only support XPath 1.0 (based on xmllib2). | `⭐⭐⭐` | By.xpath("//XCUIElementTypePopUpButton[@value=\"Regular\" and @label=\"type face\"]")

Check the [integration tests](/test/functional/find-e2e-specs.js) for more examples on different location strategies usage.


## Platform-Specific Extensions

Beside of standard W3C APIs the driver provides the below custom command extensions to execute platform specific scenarios. Use the following source code examples in order to invoke them from your client code:

```java
// Java 11+
var result = driver.executeScript("macos: <methodName>", Map.of(
    "arg1", "value1",
    "arg2", "value2"
    // you may add more pairs if needed or skip providing the map completely
    // if all arguments are defined as optional
));
```

```js
// WebdriverIO
const result = await driver.executeScript('macos: <methodName>', [{
    arg1: "value1",
    arg2: "value2",
}]);
```

```python
# Python
result = driver.execute_script('macos: <methodName>', {
    'arg1': 'value1',
    'arg2': 'value2',
})
```

```ruby
# Ruby
result = @driver.execute_script 'macos: <methodName>', {
    arg1: 'value1',
    arg2: 'value2',
}
```

```csharp
// Dotnet
object result = driver.ExecuteScript("macos: <methodName>", new Dictionary<string, object>() {
    {"arg1", "value1"},
    {"arg2", "value2"}
});
```

### macos: keys

Send keys to the given element or to the application under test

#### Arguments

Name | Type | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
elementId ("element" prior to Appium v 1.22) | string | no | Unique identifier of the element to send the keys to. If unset then keys are sent to the current application under test. | 21045BC8-013C-43BD-9B1E-4C6DC7AB0744
keys | array | yes | Array of keys to type. Each item could either be a string, that represents a key itself (see the official documentation on XCUIElement's [typeKey:modifierFlags: method](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuielement/1500604-typekey?language=objc) and on [XCUIKeyboardKey constants](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xcuikeyboardkey?language=objc)) or a dictionary with `key` and `modifierFlags` entries, if the key should also be entered with modifiers. | ['h', 'i'] or [{key: 'h', modifierFlags: 1 << 1}, {key: 'i', modifierFlags: 1 << 2}] or ['XCUIKeyboardKeyEscape'] |

> [!NOTE]
> The `modifierFlags` argument is of `unsigned long` type and defines the bitmask with depressed modifier keys for the given key.
> XCTest defines the following possible bitmasks for modifier keys:
>
> <pre>
> typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, XCUIKeyModifierFlags) {
>    XCUIKeyModifierNone       = 0,
>    XCUIKeyModifierCapsLock   = (1UL << 0),
>    XCUIKeyModifierShift      = (1UL << 1),
>    XCUIKeyModifierControl    = (1UL << 2),
>    XCUIKeyModifierOption     = (1UL << 3),
>    XCUIKeyModifierCommand    = (1UL << 4),
>    XCUIKeyModifierFunction   = (1UL << 5),
>    // These values align with UIKeyModifierFlags and CGEventFlags.
>    XCUIKeyModifierAlphaShift = XCUIKeyModifierCapsLock,
>    XCUIKeyModifierAlternate  = XCUIKeyModifierOption,
> };
> </pre>
>
> So, for example, if you want Ctrl and Shift to be depressed while entering your key then `modifierFlags` should be set to
> `(1 << 1) | (1 << 2)`, where the first constant defines `XCUIKeyModifierShift` and the seconds
> one - `XCUIKeyModifierControl`. We apply the [bitwise or](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators#or)
> (`|`) operator between them to raise both bitflags
> in the resulting value. The [left bitshift](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/bitwise-operators#left-shift)
> (`<<`) operator defines the binary bitmask for the given modifier key.
> You may combine more keys using the same approach.

## Application Under Test Concept

The Mac2 driver has the concept of `Application Under Test`. This is the app, whose bundle identifier has been passed as `bundleId` capability or as an argument to `macos: activateApp` or `macos: launchApp` extensions.
If this application is unexpectedly terminated during test session execution then an exception is going to be thrown upon any following session command invocation. In such case the driver assumes the application under test is crashed and it is impossible to proceed.
Also, the `Application Under Test` is going to be terminated when the testing session quits (unless canceled by `skipAppKill` capability).
It is possible to reset the `Application Under Test` value to none by executing `macos: terminateApp` helper and providing the bundle identifier of this app to it. Also, `macos: activateApp` or `macos: launchApp` calls can change `Application Under Test` value  if a bundle identifier different from the current one is provided to them.


## AppleScript Commands Execution

There is a possibility to run custom AppleScript
from your client code. This feature is potentially insecure and thus needs to be
explicitly enabled when executing the server by providing `apple_script` key to the list
of enabled insecure features. Check [Appium Security document](https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/security.md) for more details.
It is possible to either execute a single AppleScript command (use the `command` argument)
or a whole script (use the `script` argument) and get its
stdout in response. If the script execution returns non-zero exit code then an exception
is going to be thrown. The exception message will contain the actual stderr.
If the script is a blocking one then it could only run up to 20 seconds long. After that the script
will be terminated and a timeout error will be thrown. This timeout could be customized by
providing the `timeout` option value.
You could also customize the script working directory by providing the `cwd` option.
Here's an example code of how to get a shell command output:

```java
// java
String appleScript = "do shell script \"echo hello\"";
System.println(driver.executeScript("macos: appleScript", ImmutableMap.of("command", appleScript)));
```


## W3C Action Recipes

In theory it is possible to emulate a mouse gesture of any complexity with W3C actions.
However, there is a set of "standard" gestures, where each operating system has its own
requirements, like clicks, double clicks, etc. All such action parameters
must comply with these requirements to be recognized properly. Here is a short list of
examples for the most common macOS pointer gestures:

### Click

```json
[
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 100, "y": 100},
  {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
  {"type": "pause", "duration": 100},
  {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0}
]
```

The duration of mouse button suppression should be 0-125 ms.

### Right Click

```json
[
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 100, "y": 100},
  {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 2},
  {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 2}
]
```

The duration of mouse button suppression should be 0-125 ms.

### Double Click

```json
[
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 100, "y": 100},
  {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
  {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0},
  {"type": "pause", "duration": 1000},
  {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
  {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0}
]
```

The duration between two clicks should be 600-1000 ms.

### Drag & Drop

```json
[
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 100, "y": 100},
  {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
  {"type": "pause", "duration": 600},
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 200, "y": 200},
  {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0}
]
```

The longer is the duration of the second `pointerMove` action the lesser is the drag velocity
and vice versa. One could add more `pointerMove` actions before releasing the mouse button
to simulate complex cursor moving paths. Mac2Driver terminates action execution with a timeout
error if the duration of it exceeds 5 minutes.

### Hover

```json
[
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 10, "x": 100, "y": 100},
  {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 1000, "x": 200, "y": 200}
]
```

This snippet tells the mouse pointer to hover over [100, 100, 200, 200] area for 1 second.
In general, hover action will be performed every time if there is no preceding `pointerDown`
to the current `pointerMove` one or the preceding `pointerDown` action has been ended by
the `pointerUp` one.


## Settings API

Mac2Driver supports Appium [Settings API](https://appium.io/docs/en/advanced-concepts/settings/).
Along with the common settings the following driver-specific settings are currently available:

Name | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
boundElementsByIndex | boolean | Whether to use elements binding by index (`true`) or by accessibility identifier (the default setting, `false`). It makes sense to switch the binding strategy to workaround stale element reference errors containing `Identity Binding` text in their descriptions. See the corresponding [Stack Overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49307513/meaning-of-allelementsboundbyaccessibilityelement) to know more details on the difference between these two binding strategies.
useDefaultUiInterruptionsHandling | boolean | Whether to use the default XCTest UI interruptions handling (`true`, the default setting) or to disable it for the [Application Under Test](#application-under-test-concept) (`false`). It makes sense to disable the default handler if it is necessary to validate the interrupting element's presence in your test or do some other actions on it rather than just closing the view implicitly. Check [this WWDC presentation](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10220/) from Apple to get more details on the UI interruptions handling.


## Scripts

The Mac2 driver supports the following scripts:

### open-wda

Run `appium driver run mac2 open-wda` to open the bundled WebDriverAgentMac source in Xcode and to print the path to the main .xcodeproj file into the Terminal.


## Troubleshooting

### "WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner is from unidentified developer" system alert is shown on session startup

This is a macOS security feature and it cannot be disabled.
The only way to workaround this behavior is to configure digital signing for WDA.
Check [the Stackoverlow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41062607/osx-complains-that-app-is-from-unidentified-developer-although-it-passes-all-va)
for more details on how to do it. Use the [open-wda driver script](#open-wda) to quickly
open WebDriverAgent sources in Xcode.


## Examples

```python
# Python3 + PyTest
import pytest

from appium import webdriver
# Options are available in Python client since v2.6.0
from appium.options.mac import Mac2Options
from appium.webdriver.common.appiumby import AppiumBy


@pytest.fixture()
def driver():
    options = Mac2Options()
    options.bundle_id = 'com.apple.TextEdit'
    # The default URL is http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub in Appium1
    drv = webdriver.Remote('http://127.0.0.1:4723', options=options)
    yield drv
    drv.quit()


def test_edit_text(driver):
    edit_field = driver.find_element(by=AppiumBy.CLASS_NAME, value='XCUIElementTypeTextView')
    edit_field.send_keys('hello world')
    assert edit_field.text == 'hello world'
    edit_field.clear()
    assert edit_field.text == ''


def test_sending_custom_keys(driver):
    edit_field = driver.find_element(by=AppiumBy.CLASS_NAME, value='XCUIElementTypeTextView')
    flagsShift = 1 << 1
    driver.execute_script('macos: keys', {
        'keys': [{
            'key': 'h',
            'modifierFlags': flagsShift,
        }, {
            'key': 'i',
            'modifierFlags': flagsShift,
        }]
    })
    assert edit_field.text == 'HI'
```


## Parallel Execution

Parallel execution of multiple Mac2 driver instances is highly discouraged. Only one UI test must be running at the same time, since the access to accessibility layer is single-threaded. Also HID devices, like the mouse or the keyboard, must be acquired exclusively.

## Environment Variables

The server part of the driver recognizes the following environment variables:

- `ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SCREENSHOTS`: enables automatic XCTest screenshots.
  These screenshots are stored in the same folder where WDA test logs are located and are taken automatically.
  This feature is disabled by default. Only enable it if you know what you are doing otherwise these
  screenshots may quickly fill up the free disk space.
- `ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SCREEN_RECORDINGS`: enables automatic XCTest screen recordings.
  These screen recordings are stored in the same folder where WDA test logs are located and are taken automatically. This feature is disabled by default.
  Only enable it if you know what you are doing otherwise these videos may quickly fill up the free disk space.
  The native screen recording feature only works on Xcode 15+.
- `USE_PORT`. If enabled then the server listens on the given port. Otherwise, a random free port from the
  10100..10200 range is selected. By default, the port is selected by the driver (see the `appium:systemPort`
  capability description).
- `VERBOSE_LOGGING`. If enabled then server logs should include various verbose details. Disabled by default.

## Development & Testing

This module uses the same [development tools](https://github.com/appium/appium/tree/master/docs/cn/contributing-to-appium) as the other Appium drivers.

Check out the source. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

Execute `npm run test` to run unit tests and `npm run e2e-test` to run integration tests.


## Notes

- W3C actions support is limited (only mouse actions are supported). You could also use `macos:` extension APIs to cover your test scenarios
